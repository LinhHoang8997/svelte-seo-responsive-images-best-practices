# Example for SEO folks - Use of picture element for responsive images
An example of the `<picture>` element being used to serve a differently sized WebP image to the browser depending on the viewport width of the device in question

# Why use the `<picture>` element?
- It allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image to serve to the user
- It preserves art directions as it allows specific variations to be shown depending on highly-readable media queries
- It's a native HTML element that has extensive and comprehensive documentation
- It's supported by all modern browsers
- In my own experience, it's a lot easier to use (and less error-prone) than the srcset attribute on the img element
